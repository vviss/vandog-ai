# vandog-ai
AI segmenter and cartoonizer

Important: 
GitHub limits the size of the files to 25MB. 
The Mask-RCNN model used for image segmentation is well above 10x this limit.
Until the model download is made programmatically available, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository on your local machine
- Download the .h5 file (segmenter model weights) from: 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Ul0L6I2l-k8pkPOARKcPiS0iAS8GLUr/view?usp=sharing
- Move the downloaded file to vandog-ai/VanDog/MASK_RCNN/

This project is a proof of concept only - have fun with it!
